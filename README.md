# Using LLMs for common bioinformatics tasks

This repository contains the instructions, code and data which form part of the 2025 Joint International BioHackathon.

The project aims to look at the use of LLMs as assistants for common bioinformatics tasks.  Each of the tasks listed here is the sort of thing a bioinformatician will be asked to do as part of their work.  We would like to see if these tasks are something which an LLM could undertake, and look at factors which contribute to success.

The tasks can be undertaken in any order, and we don't need people to do all of them (although that would be nice).  You can even have a go at the same task multiple times using different prompt strategies - this would be really interesting to see.  What we ask is that you keep a log of the interactions you have with the LLM and the successes / failures you find from the advice it gives.  After the runs of the tasks are complete we will then review the results of the trials to pick out trends which may assist others in deciding whether an LLM will help them, and strategies to ensure the best chance of success.

## Running a task

To get all of the data associated with this project you can clone this repository to the machine you are using.  

To do this you will need to install git, and then clone the repository.  If you don't know how to do this - ask an LLM! (and record how it went)

For each task the key information we would like to record is:

1. Which task are you undertaking
2. Which LLM are you using to assist
3. What your level of comfort would be in acheiving this task unaided (could do it easily, would need a bit of help, no idea where to start etc)
4. For each prompt you give the LLM we want:
  a. The prompt you gave
  b. The answer you got (at least the part which you acted on if it's long)
  c. What happened when you followed the advice - did it work, fail, give an error etc.
5. At the end we want to know
  a. Do you think you completed the task successully?
  b. Do you think the LLM helped, or would you have found it easier without, or just using conventional web searches?
  c. Would you do anything different in your prompting if you were to do this again?


## Things to consider
To try to capture a broader range of outcomes from this there are some things you could consider varying in your approach

### Different LLMs
* Which LLM to use
  * [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
  * [Claude](https://claude.ai/)
  * [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
  * [Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
  * [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/)
  * [ScienceOS](https://www.scienceos.ai/science-ai-chat/)
 
If you don't have an LLM subscription then you may only get limited access to these models so mix it up trying out different ones.

### Different prompt strategies
When constructing your prompts you could try different approaches.

Obvious things are to vary the amount of detail you provide in the prompt to see how that affects the outcome.

You could also try changing the persona of the LLM - tell it what sort of an LLM you want it to be "Answer as if you were a highly technical computational biologist", or "Answer as if you were explaining in simple terms to someone who doesn't understand much about computers" etc.

This is your chance to try things out so be creative!
