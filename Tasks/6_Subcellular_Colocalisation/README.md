# Colocalisation of Subcellular Structures

**Using any programming language or open-source image analysis software (e.g. Fiji or napari) please identify whether the sub-cellular structures in each channel image spatially co-occur.**

You have been provided with two individual-channel images of the same field of view containing some U2OS cells.[1]
- Channel image 1: Hoechst staining of nuclei
- Channel image 2: SYTO14 staining of nucleoli and cytoplasmic RNA.
